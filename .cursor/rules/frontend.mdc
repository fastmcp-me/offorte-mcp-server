# Frontend & Javasccript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Follow mobile-first responsive design.
- Avoid CSS-in-JS solutions (e.g., Emotion).
- When creating a frontend based on an uploaded image, be as close to the original as possible and double check the styling so it matches the image exactly.
- Use the installed dependencies over introducing something new.
- Use existing components from the (mono)repo.
- Use Prettier & Lint configurations from the (mono)repo to ensure consistent code style and best practices.
- For if statements, always use braces, even for single-line blocks.
- Use the installed dependencies over introducing something new.

# Naming Conventions
- Directories/Files: Use lowercase with dashes (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Components: Favor named exports.

# Package Manager
- Use PNPM
- Use fixed versions for dependencies
