# Typescript
- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Keep Typescript simple and easy to read, prefer close to Javascript over TS specifics
- Prefer interfaces over types; avoid enums, use maps.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use function keyword for pure functions.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use existing code from the (mono)repo where possible.

# Naming Conventions
- Directories/Files: Use lowercase with dashes (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Components: Favor named exports.
